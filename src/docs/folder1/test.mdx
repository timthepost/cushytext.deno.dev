This page is here so you can see how sub-folders and Mermaid diagrams work.

## Diagrams

Here's a simple Mermaid diagram:

<div class="mermaid_wrapper">
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A-->B;
  A-->C;
  B-->D;
  C-->D;
```
</div>

It was generated using `mermaid` markup in a code fence, with `mermaid` as 
the language hint. An example is the graph above:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A-->B;
  A-->C;
  B-->D;
  C-->D;
```
````

Much more complex arrangements are possible, as well as customizations.
