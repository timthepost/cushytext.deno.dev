# {title}

The reason this group is at the bottom of the list is because the 
`index.mdx` in this folder, `folder1/`, has an `order` value of 
15. That orders this folder low in the main nav. Here's the contents
of {docs.basedir}index.mdx:

```jsx
---
title: Example Folder Named folder1/
menu:
  visible: true
  order: 15
---
```

The name of the index is the name of the category. Now, the `order` setting on 
the individual files within this folder control the order in which they appear
in the group. Or, leave them all set at 0 for auto sort.

Folders work one-level deep, which is pretty good for a template hack!
