This page is here so you can see how it works.

## Sort Order (menu.order):

The reason this group is at the bottom of the list is because the 
`index.mdx` in this folder, `folder1/`, has an `order` value of 
15. That orders this folder low in the main nav. Here's the contents
of {docs.basedir}index.mdx:

```jsx
---
title: Example Folder Named folder1/
menu:
  visible: true
  order: 15
---
```

## Group / Category Naming:

The name of the index in any directory is the name of the category. Now, the 
`order` setting on the individual files within this folder control the order 
in which they appear in the group. The orders should be the same or _greater_
than the order assigned to the index.

Folders work one-level deep, which is pretty good for a template hack!
