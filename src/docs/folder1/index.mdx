# {title}

this is {docs.basedir}/folder1/index.mdx.

Index files in sub folders set the name of the category. If there's 
no index with a `title`, the folder name is used instead. Notice 
this file has an order of 15 from its frontmatter:

```yml
---
title: Example folder1/ Category
menu:
  visible: true
  order: 15
seo:
  ignore: true
metas:
  robots: false
---
```

This pins it to the bottom, unless something else is added with 
a value _greater_ than 15. The nav is built based on `menu.order`
_ascending_.

Pages in this section / category should have a value of _at least_
the same as this in order for the progress (next / prev) nav
paths to work.

Feel free to delete this entire folder; it's just here to show 
you how sub-folders work in docs.
