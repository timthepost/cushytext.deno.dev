# How Does Theme / Font Switching Work?

In an ideal world, the user doesn't have to toggle things on a 
site, because _everything_ about their preferences can be known
in advance. We're not there yet, but the strategy is obey what
we can get correct automatically, and provide controls as 
fallback.

Some settings (like prefers dyslexic font) don't quite exist yet
in the form `prefers-color-scheme` does, and some don't even have
a universal designation for what icon should enable them.

So we just try to do our best. 

## What are data-theme and data-font? 

At the right of the top navigation bar, there are two switches, 
one that toggles light and dark mode, and another that toggles
between the default system font and a user-preferred font, which
in this case is OpenDyslexic.

In `src/_includes/js/main.js` there are events that run when the
buttons are clicked, which toggles the theme or the font. The 
preference is stored in local storage, and synchronized when the
document loads. There's also a dictionary to translate `system` to 
the default Infima font family, and `user` to OpenDyslexic, in
case you want to change the font it toggles.

## Working With Light / Dark Mode In CSS

We try to go by `prefers-color-scheme`, if it's available, so 
we know if they want a darker theme by default. Selecting one 
or the other stores their preference in local storage. 

As you design with both themes in mind, you'll find that you 
need to adjust how something looks but only in a specific mode.
In order to scope that, use `data-theme`. 

Here's an example from the tags in this theme:

```css 
.post-tag:hover {
  background-color: var(--ifm-color-secondary);
  color: var(--ifm-color-black);
  text-decoration: none;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  .post-tag:hover {
    border: 1px solid var(--ifm-color-gray-700);
    background-color: var(--ifm-color-info);
  }
}
```

You can find a list of default color variables for both light and
dark mode in `src/_includes/css/theme-variables.css`.

## Adjusting CSS Automatically For Font Changes

Much like dark mode, larger fonts with thicker borders tend to wreak
unanticipated havoc. Sometimes you want a slightly larger `min-height`
or perhaps less padding. This is possible in a similar way to scoping
the theme, except we're going by the font value.

Here's an example from the [front page of this site](/) where the cards
line up under the hero:

```css
/* Example of adapting design to a font-switch */
.homepage_card {
  min-height: 275px;
}

[data-font="user"] {
  .homepage_card {
    min-height: 365px;
  }
}
```

Otherwise, the page would not transform well when switched.
