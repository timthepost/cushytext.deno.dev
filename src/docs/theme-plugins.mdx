# {title}

I needed a lightweight TOC plugin to work independently of the 
Markdown plugin being used, so I ended up writing one myself 
which does a pretty good job if you prefer a simple, flat 
TOC like I do.

If you don't, and prefer a more indented one, I'll happily take
a PR.

I also ended up writing a SEO plugin that catches a huge number of 
common mistakes before they mess up your site's SEO standing. I don't
make promises on results, only that you'll get in the way of them 
less through common mistakes.

<h2 id="toc-plugin">TOC Options & configuration</h2>

***The theme will not function properly with this plugin removed.*** Unless, of course, 
you install another Markdown plugin to handle it. There are the configurable options to 
control generation:

| Function | Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Configured Value |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| TOC | `toc_selector` | string | ID of the container where the generated TOC will land. | `#toc` | `#toc` |
| TOC | `toc_container` | string | Class name of the container to scan for headings. | `.toc-enabled` | `.toc-enabled` |
| TOC | `toc_heading_selectors` | string | Comma-separated list of headings to process. | `h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` | `h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` |
| TOC | `toc_list_class` | string | Class name to apply to the generated TOC list. | empty | `table-of-contents padding-top--none` |
| TOC | `toc_link_class` | string | Class name to apply to generated TOC links. | empty | `table-of-contents__link` |

And, here's how the plugin is loaded in the theme (from `plugins.ts`):

```js
  .use(toc({
    // Container where the TOC is deposited once generated
    toc_selector: "#toc",
    // Content within this container is scanned for headings
    toc_container: ".toc-enabled",
    // Headings to scan for and extract / anchor 
    toc_heading_selectors: "h2, h3, h4, h5, h6",
    // class to apply to generated TOC links
    toc_link_class: "table-of-contents__link",
    // class to apply to generated TOC list
    toc_list_class: "table-of-contents padding-top--none",
  }))
```

<h2 id="simple-seo" class="margin-top--md"> SEO Static Analysis Plugin (AKA Simple SEO)</h2>

The SEO plugin tries to catch semantic mistakes that are 
common when creating with Markdown-driven static templates,
like sites generated with Lume. In a nutshell it catches issues 
like:

 - Length of titles, descriptions, overall content length,
   presence of important meta elements

 - Semantic checks, like making sure headings in rendered
   pages appear in proper order (h1 - h6)

 - HTML element checks like image alt text checks, image 
   title checks, which also helps accessibility 

 - Common word percentage calculation tags that can make 
   a big difference in indexing, like titles and descriptions

The plugin works by extracting as much information as it can from 
the `Document` object Lume provides for every rendered page. Where 
information can't be obtained directly from the document, frontmatter
is used. 

The plugin offers configurability through many options that 
you can pass when loading, as well as per-page overrides you
can use in `_data.yml` files or frontmatter.

<h2 id="simple-seo-internationalization" class="margin-top--md"> Internationalization Features Of The SEO Plugin</h2>

There are several key places where anyone running a multi-language
site might want to take notice, as I've tried my best to keep the 
plugin as flexible and configurable as possible:

 - The common word list : which allows you to use a different 
   set of words than the default English set for calculating
   common word percentages.

 - The common word percentage callback option : which lets you
   provide your own calculation function yourself (the plugin
   will provide a string, you return a percentage from 0.00 to 1.00).

 - The default locale option : The plugin uses the `Intl.Segmenter()` API
   and passes the page locale along with the text to it, but you supply 
   a default in case once isn't set. This lets you run the plugin once 
   per language supported safely.

 - The length unit option :  This lets you tell the plugin that you 
   want to represent lengths in words, graphemes or even sentences
   instead of the default characters.

 - The option to ignore pages in all locales BUT the one you specify, 
   which makes it convenient to treat pages in different languages 
   with different settings, generating different reports, etc.

<h2 id="simple-seo-plugin-use" class="margin-top--md">Example Multi-Language Setup:</h2>

Here's a complex configuration where the plugin is invoked twice, once per 
language, with different options for each:

```js
// below the last plugin import ...
import { japaneseCommonWords } from "cushytext-theme/_plugins/seo/japanese_common_words.js";

  // later on, after most other plugins run

  .use(
    seo({
      output: "./_seo_report.json",
      ignore: ["/404.html"],
      lengthUnit: "character",
      lengthLocale: "en",
      ignoreAllButLocale: "en",
      logOperations: false
    }),
  )
  .use(
    seo({
      output: "./_seo_report_ja.json",
      ignore: ["/404.html"],
      lengthUnit: "word",
      lengthLocale: "ja",
      userCommonWordSet: japaneseCommonWords,
      ignoreAllButLocale: "ja",
      logOperations: false
    }),
  )
```

<h2 id="simple-seo-plugin-use" class="margin-top--md">Example Single-Language Setup:</h2>

Let's say you just needed a different custom words dictionary:

```js
  const esCommonWords = new Set<string>;

  // ... fill out esCommonWords similar to the ones in the plugin ....

  .use(
    seo({
      output: "./_seo_report_en.json",
      ignore: ["/admin/", "/dev/", "/404.html"],
      lengthUnit: "character",
      lengthLocale: "es",
      ignoreAllButLocale: "es",
      userCommonWordSet: esCommonWords
    }),
  )
```

English users really only need to worry about the thresholds and which checks to run.

<h2 id="simple-seo-plugin-generators" class="margin-top--md">Dealing With Generator Functions:</h2>

Sometimes, we use generator functions to generate a lot of files, and we may want to 
squelch things like content length warnings. To do this, place a `_data.yml` file in
the same directory as your generator function, and set the frontmatter options there.

For instance, tag pages on this site are generated by generators that live in `/generators`,
isolated specifically so I can easily control their frontmatter, e.g.:

`src/generators/_data.yml`:

```yml
seo:
  skip_content: true
```

Theme defaults are very conservative; everyone will want to configure thresholds depending
on their needs. That's why everything (practically) is configurable.

<h2 id="rest-endpoint" class="margin-top--md">Adding a RESTful Report Endpoint To Middleware:</h2>

The following code will set up a route that will (if in local mode with `LUME_DRAFTS` set), also 
set up the API to proxy the SEO report results. This can be useful for pulling in issues in your
browser using `fetch()`.

You can also allow the public to access them if your community is one that likes to take on 
janitorial tasks.

```js
const DEV_MODE = Deno.env.get("LUME_DRAFTS") || false;

router.get("/api/seo-report", ({ _request }) => {
  if (! DEV_MODE) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Not in dev mode" }), { 
      status: 500,
    });
  }
  const path = "./_seo_report.json";
  try {
    const data = Deno.readTextFileSync(path);
    return new Response(data, { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    // it's not there
    if (error instanceof Deno.errors.NotFound) {
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "File not found" }), {
        status: 404,
      });
    }
    // umm, neither is the backing storage LOL. Read denied!
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Internal server error" }), {
      status: 500,
    });
  }
});
```

If there's no report, the status will be set to 404. If something else happens
(like GH storage timing out), it will return a status of 500. You can do something
similar with other reports, if you're building an admin dashboard.

<h2 id="seo-plugin-initial-config" class="margin-top--md">Setting The Initial Defaults</h2>

The initial defaults are conservative and basically "best practices based" 
on English content recommendations when it comes to Title and Meta Description
lengths. 

Content length, and common word percentage, however, are really more dependent on 
your topic and content style. What I recommend you do is set the values low enough
so that all of your pages trip the checks, look at the reported values of your 
best-performing pages, adjust the bar so that it no longer trips on them, and 
then you have some initial goals and tests to run.

SEO is a black box. If you provide accessible pages with clear, useful content 
organized in logical, descriptive headings, you'll do as well as you can with 
your content alone. Back links, content age and lots of other things affect 
how you rank and even what gets indexed.

You want the settings to push you to give yourself the best shot that you can, 
without being so annoying that you just constantly ignore them or shut them up
with frontmatter. If it gets to that, what's the point of the plugin?

Reach out to me on the Cushy Text Discord or via email if you need help with this
part, or have suggestions to share for better defaults, etc.

<h2 id="seo-plugin-roadmap" class="margin-top--md">Simple SEO New Feature Roadmap:</h2>

More checks, of course, as they make sense. Additionally, some kind of caching
should be implemented so the plugin is only iterating through each document a 
dozen times if they're new, or have changed since the last time.

I'm pretty sure I can just hash `page.document`? Looking into it. If you have
a hundred pages in three languages, this plugin could add considerable length 
to builds, so I'd like to minimize that.

Plus, this thing already has ***twenty-one frigging options*** 😱 so why not make it
fifty? 😂
