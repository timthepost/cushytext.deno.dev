# {title}

In the simplest form, a [component in Lume][1] is just a bit of 
HTML with some variables that is returned by an asynchronous 
function; great for creating the little utilities that make
creating pages easier and more maintainable.

An example of a component used in the site right now is the one
that fetches the latest blog post on this site's index page, 
which comes from `src/_components/latestBlog.vto`:

```js
{{ for post of search.pages(
    "waypoint=%blog% menu.visible=true", 
    "date=desc", (max_posts || 1)) }}
    <!--  show the content of max_posts posts -->
{{ /for }}
```

This is called in the index template with the following code:

```js
  {{ await comp.latestBlog({ max_posts: 1 }) }}
```

Neat, right?

But it's not fun to develop css, JS and template code all in the same 
file, nor is it advisable to have style sheets and scripts full of 
code to support features that went away long ago, so wouldn't it be 
more ideal if components could manage just that bare minimum for
themselves?

That would be really cool, and that's what's happening in Lume.

## New Component Layout In Lume 3

Instead of just `_components/` with a bunch of files, we're moving to this 
structure:

```
  _components/
      - siteComponent/
          - comp.vto    < The template code
          - style.css   < Any classes written just for it
          - script.js   < JS for events, whatever else it needs to work
```

So, when you used `comp.siteComponent()`, it would automatically load what it
needs. You can edit with working IDE highlighting, and your site doesn't 
get loaded down with CSS from unused junk (we have plugins to strip away 
unused classes anyway, but I digress).

Optimization and removing unused classes is of course going to happen in 
plugins, but there's still a lot of potential per-page savings. And, these
components easily transcend into MDX, which will be well-documented once
Lume 3 is stable.

Right now, development is happening against `v3-dev`, which is actually 
rather stable, but there's a ton of new stuff for those not already caught 
up.

## Using Lume 3 Components In MDX Pages And Vento Templates:

The `comp` property in Lume is the way to access components in 
MDX/JSX or through templates. In MDX you would:

```js
<comp.alert type="warning" allowDismiss="false" message="Boo!" />
```


In Vento, you'll need to supply an `await`, as all components in 
Lume 3 are now asynchronous:

```js
{{ await comp.alert({type: "warning", message: "Boo!" }) }}
```

_Note that your component JS code should immediately exit if it 
doesn't apply to the current page. While it is loaded on-demand,
it still gets put in the global scope._

## The Goal: Lume 3 Style For Any Component That Loads Assets

Eventually, the Infima components _that make sense_ as well as 
things like tag and navigation helpers will be available as Lume 3 
components. There's already some filling in.

When writing something that runs more than once, or in more than one 
place, think strongly about making it a component. If that component 
loads css and / or JS in addition to Infima, ***it should be a Lume 3
component***. Nothing will break horribly if you use the old style, 
except the heart of the next maintainer.

If your component doesn't load scripts or styles, just use the old-style
components.

It's not practical to write component wrappers around 100% of Infima,
or significantly reduce its size by making its own component CSS 
pluggable, and still be compatible with people who want to copy over
existing content.

The `pages` archetype is the last one to be finished, and it will be the 
result of being able to produce real results with very little markup or
deep programming or design knowledge using these components.
