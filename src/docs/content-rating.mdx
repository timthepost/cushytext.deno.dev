# {title}

The content rating component is powered by [Lume 3 Router Middleware](/docs/middleware/) 
and consists of two components:

 1. The front-end form & survey component: `comp.feedback()`, and, 
 
 2. The (kinda) back-end admin component: `comp.feedbackAdmin()`. 

The first one produces the form that gathers the vote and optional 
feedback. It then saves the input to DenoKV (and / or Discord, soon,
along with other options).

The second adds a table that lets you manage the feedback (currently, 
delete).

## Anonymous Content Feedback Survey Component

On the right-sidebar of every document page, you'll see a little widget
that lets you express how you feel about reading the current article. That 
widget uses the Router middleware to process the form submission and inserts 
the feedback into a DenoKV database or anything else that can take input from 
a call to `fetch()`. I plan to have it also work with posting (via Bot) to 
Discord. The survey is visible in the right sidebar on every page in `/docs`;
here it is expanded:

<img 
  src="/uploads/content/feedback-input.png" 
  alt="feedback input form" 
  title="Expanded view of the feedback form" 
  style="border-radius: 1em"
  />

Feedback submits to `yourdomain.com/api/feedback` via POST request and has a 
built-in honeypot. I'm currently investigating possible integrations
with privacy-respecting captcha services.

You can use it in a template like this:

```js
{{ await comp.feedback({ basename: url })}}
```
or in a MDX post (blog / docs) like this:

```jsx
<comp.feedback basename={url} />
```

The `basename` variable is used literally as _the base name_ of the key
that gets created to store the feedback entry. It's indexed by type, 
url. If using the redirects plugin, use the _oldest_ URL of the
group.

You're welcome to use it for the blog too! But perhaps make a copy of 
the plugin as `blogFeedback` and add another locale entry, so you can
have different CTAs, vote buttons, etc. 

## Anonymous Content Feedback Admin Component

The `comp.feedbackAdmin()` plugin lets you put an admin area for the 
anonymous feedback wherever it's convenient for you to put it. 

Designed to run _locally_ only, it works in conjunction with `/api/feedback` 
to get a list of feedback and keys, display it, and provide a convenient means
of deleting it:

<img 
  src="/uploads/content/feedback-admin.png" 
  alt="feedback admin table" 
  title="Bare bones, but sufficient."
  style="border-radius: 1em;" 
  />

It puts a container in the document that receives a table from a 
call to `fetch()` against a route which only works if `LUME_DRAFTS`
is set.

To use it in a template:

```js
{{ await comp.feedbackAdmin() }}
```

Or in MDX:

```jsx
<comp.feedbackAdmin />
```

## Creating A Local-Only '/admin' Route

If you put the following in any directory, including the `src/` root directory,
you'll get an "admin" area that only works locally. This can be accomplished by
taking advantage of the fact that Lume will render drafts locally if `LUME_DRAFTS`
is set, which is also used by CushyDocs to control dev mode. I named mine `src/cushy-admin.mdx`
because I find `http://localhost:3000/cushy-admin/` the most convenient since it doesn't
conflict with the CMS. 

You do you, here's the sparse code you'll need:

```jsx
---
title: Local Admin Area
layout: layouts/page.vto
draft: true
menu:
  display: true
  order: -1
---

<h1>{title}</h1>

<comp.feedbackAdmin />
```

The component will load a script that runs in your browser, which communicates with 
`/api/feedback` to display and / or delete feedback. You'll find the routes defined
in [`src/_server_routes.ts`](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext-theme/blob/main/src/_server_routes.ts)
(Github Link).

## Deno Deploy Environmental Variables

Place your `DENO_KV_ACCESS_TOKEN` as well as `DENO_KV_URL` (see below) in a file named 
`.env-local`, then before running the local server, run:

```bash
> source envloader
```

There will be notice that the variables were loaded. Or, however you like to do it.

The `DENO_KV_URL` is found in Deno Deploy, in the KV tab, for the string you should
pass to `Deno.openKv()` if connecting away from Deno Deploy (e.g. console). If it's 
not set in your environment, Deno will just fall back to local sqlite, and you won't
see any data. 

That's it! Deno KV is pretty much zero config; that's one of the reasons I chose it.
