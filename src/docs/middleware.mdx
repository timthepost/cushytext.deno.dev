# {title}

Normally, words like "middleware" aren't very exciting, but the Router that 
is shipping in Lume 3 is what enables static sites to have interactive functions
without having to fuss with edge functions.

On Deno Deploy, Lume runs this theme through Deno running `src/_serve.ts`, which loads 
`_server_routes.ts`. which makes the same server handing out all of your pages also 
accept form submissions and relay responses to them. And, it works locally or remotely 
the exact same way!

## How Is Middleware Set Up?

If you run the local server on port 3000 and go to `/api`, you'll see a timestamp. It's
being dynamically generated by a handler in `_server_routes.ts`, which is where the theme
middleware ships. 

Here:<strong> <a href="/api" target="_blank">try it live here on the current site</a>
</strong>, then have a look at the code that produces it:

```js
import Router from "lume/middlewares/router.ts";

const router = new Router();

router.get("/api", ({ _request }) => {
  const ts = Date.now();
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ping: ts }), { status: 200 });
});

export default router;
```

You can set up synchronous or asynchronous handlers for `GET`, `POST` and
`DELETE`, where you can do I/O with DenoKV or other databases, await the 
return of `fetch()` to pull in content, or whatever you'd normally use 
edge functions for. 

Don't go trying to crunch a Monte Carlo simulation in one, mkay? But you've
got room to run standard logistics. This isn't for serving dynamic pages, 
just for handling things that are needed to bring interactivity to sites.

## Roadmap For Using Lume 3's Router In Cushy Text

Right now, [`src/_server_routes.ts`](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext/blob/main/src/_server_routes.ts)
(Github Link) is a very cluttered mess. 

Off the bat, there are two main things wrong with it:

 - I need to pick and use a validator library. Still mulling over which one
   I like. Something very lightweight. In many of the libraries that I like
   (e.g. Oak), it's actually built into the request _context itself_ which 
   is an interesting approach, but would require Lume to provide it. I'm interested
   in suggestions for something simple going forward.

 - The code needs to be back-end agnostic. I plan to move all the code that talks
   to DenoKV into a module and call it FeedbackStorage. That naturally means we 
   can have `FeedbackStorage.submit()`, `FeedbackStorage.list()`, `FeedbackStorage.reset()` 
   and `FeedbackStorage.delete()`. This allows you to use Discord, GH Issues, or whatever 
   else you can manage with calls from `fetch()` in a middleware-appropriate way. Maybe 
   even chain them together? DenoKV + GHIssues?

***You write your routes any way you like; I'm just talking about the theme 
defaults.*** I don't want to force DenoKV on anyone, even though Deno hosting is 
required for all of it to work. And, I see the use in Discord / GH issues for this
kind of thing.

This should be implemented in one of the very early versions, not sure if the second 
or the third. I'll be using Harmony (Deno) for Discord as Discordeno would be overkill, 
and probably just Octokit for the GH stuff. I'll happily take PRs that advances either
cause.
