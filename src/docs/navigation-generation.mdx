# {title}
  
Navigation, at the moment, is auto-generated for **docs** and **blog** archetypes, 
and specified in a file named `navbar.yml` for static header and footer links. 

The goal is to have as much auto-generated as possible, taking clues from individual
`_data.yml` files in each directory as needed.
  
## Main Files Of Interest Right Now

Most of the navigation happens in `src/_includes/partials/nav.vto`, where (from top down)
we go from left to right for the normal, full-size nav.

From there, we get to the responsive fly-out nav, which begins at:

```html
<div role="presentation" class="navbar-sidebar__backdrop"></div>
```

This is the backdrop that's shown if you're in a documentation or blog area
and is auto-generated, followed by the navigation links controlled by the 
`navbar.yml` file.

This file also controls the footer links and footer group headings. 

## The "menu" Frontmatter Settings

In frontmatter (`page.data`) you'll see a `menu` object with two settings:
`order` and `visible`. 

By default, every page or post or document (or source file processed by lume)
has its visibility set to `true`, and `order` set to `0`, which is essentially
_no more, no less important than anything else_ in terms of navigation.

This is a setting that doesn't _yet_ control all aspects of navigation and 
things of that nature, but _could_ if you wanted it to. It's there for you 
to build on.

It's currently used when displaying auto-nav links in the blog and documentation,
(passed along to the search functions), and set by default in the root `_data.yml`
file, so you can count on it being there unless you change it.

If you set an individual page to `visible: false`, it shouldn't be picked up by the
auto nav, or plugins like `comp.latestBlog()`, or listed in the archive. If you find
a case where that isn't true, a PR is most welcome. The feature is there to help you
create pages that exist, but require a link to find. 

Better coordination with the Sitemap generator plugin is planned, but not yet started.

## Roadmap

We should be able to implement the `menu` hook on everything, in addition to 
some help from `_data.yml` files to _almost_ completely generate the navigation 
leaving room for what is usually manual anyway. 

The nav generation in `docs/` is more important for current focus, YAML is 
fine for now for static links.
