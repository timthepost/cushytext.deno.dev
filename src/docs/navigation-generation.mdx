# {title}
  
Navigation, at the moment, is auto-generated for **docs** and **blog** archetypes, 
and specified in a file named `navbar.yml` for static header and footer links. 

The goal is to have as much auto-generated as possible, taking clues from individual
`_data.yml` files in each directory as needed.
  
## Main Files Of Interest Right Now

Most of the navigation happens in `src/_includes/partials/nav.vto`, where (from top down)
we go from left to right for the normal, full-size nav.

From there, we get to the responsive fly-out nav, which begins at:

```html
<div role="presentation" class="navbar-sidebar__backdrop"></div>
```

This is the backdrop that's shown if you're in a documentation or blog area
and is auto-generated, followed by the navigation links controlled by the 
`navbar.yml` file.

This file also controls the footer links and footer group headings. 

## Roadmap

We should be able to implement the `menu` hook on everything, in addition to 
some help from `_data.yml` files to _almost_ completely generate the navigation 
leaving room for what is usually manual anyway. 

The nav generation in `docs/` is more important for current focus, YAML is 
fine for now for static links.
