# {title}
  
First, even if you're not going to use the blog feature very much, please
take a look at [how the blog system works in Cushy Text](/docs/blog-system/).

A _considerable_ amount of the concepts are the same, because `docs/` is 
a very trimmed-down version of the blog system, with the addition of having
a different kind of auto-generated navigation and the built-in content rating
system enabled by default. 
  
## Docs Data File Configuration:

Just like in [the blog system](/docs/blog-system/), docs is multi-instance and
controlled by settings in the `_data.yml` file. Looking at the one that powers
this instance:

```yml
layout: layouts/docs.vto
waypoint: "%theme-docs%"
type: docs
menu:
  visible: true
  order: 0
docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  title: "Cushy Theme Docs"
  sidebar: auto
  guest:
    heading: "Latest Blog Post:"
    waypoint: "%blog%"
    posts: 1
```

Note that I have the inclusion of a **menu** property here, which has its 
own **visibility** and **order** properties. This controls if the file will
be rendered in the side nav (both the full-size and hamburger), and 
what order it should appear if so.

Sort orders can be any signed integer. -10 will always be on top if your 
default value is 0, unless you change the template files. Which you can
totally do.

We have a **sidebar** property that right now, only supports `auto`, but 
will eventually support a custom object of some kind. 

There's also a **guest** property, which tells the sidebar navigation to 
pull in a post from the blog (not shown on small screens to save room)

## Docs Differences From Blog Posts:

There are some differences that you should be aware of:

 1. Docs let you set the `<h1>` tag. Blogs set this automatically. 

 2. Docs has auto-pagination with progress at the bottom of every 
    page, matching the order of the nav. Blogs have this, but 
    it's _only_ controlled by date, there's no `order` to sort by
    with blogs.
  
 3. Docs do not display tags. They could, if you wanted them to, but 
    I didn't see a need for them. You can of course _apply_ them and 
    use them for searches and queries, but no pages are generated
    for them and they aren't otherwise really used in docs.

## Docs RSS / JSON Feed Configuration:

Right now, `/docs` comes manually set-up wih the theme so you have the 
documentation right there when developing and customizing it. The feed
is set up in `plugins.ts` where the rest of the feeds are created. 

## Docs Subdirectory Setup 

The title of the `index.mdx` file in any sub directory will be the title
of the category in the nav. If there's no `index.mdx` file, then the folder
name is used as the category name.

To control where a category sits in the overall nav, adjust the `menu.order`
property of the index file in that directory. To control where files within 
directories appear in the nav, adjust their individual `menu.order` settings.

Default is ascending (`/docs/index.mdx` has a value of -1 to stay on top).

See `docs/folder1/` for a practical example.

## Docs Feature Roadmap In The Theme:

Need better closers / styles for the nav (or, to just use them correctly,
which we don't currently do quite yet)
