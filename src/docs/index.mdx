# Getting Started:

The theme isn't officially released until a short time after Lume 3 releases, 
which will likely be mid-May 2025. I'll list the theme in the Lume Theme Gallery
after the launch of v3 settles. There are still daily updates to contend with 
to stay mostly lock-step with `lume-dev`.

However, You can head over to the [theme repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext-theme) 
now if you want, and use the theme via Git. You're also welcome to use the SEO 
plugin.

The `0.0.1` release is still _technically_ pre-release. I'll be converting the 
template repo over to an actual template repo once it gets listed in the theme
registry.

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>
 - Re-doing the docs auto nav with the [Nav plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/nav/), 
   which I think also helps solve the nested sections and custom sidebar import 
   complications (though custom would have to follow the nav plugin output format).
   **Docs currently does not handle nested directories very well with the way it 
   generates navigation (or headings, in general)**.
 - More robust archetype scripts and CMS integration.
 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.
 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.
 - More content-building components (tabs, responsive YT player helper, docs index
   page generator) Perhaps a selective generator for Discord Q&A as the start of a 
   FAQ component.
 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

I've set up a [low-volume Discord server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH) to coordinate efforts. You can
also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.

Please ***expect frequent breaking changes***. I don't knowingly push bugs 
live, but it does happen - if it's still broken in a few days please open an 
issue.

Standard [contributing guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) apply.
