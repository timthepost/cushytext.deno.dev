Tag Wikis are designed to give [tag archive pages](/archive/announcements/) some more usefulness.

They can be used to add more content about tags that your site uses, which helps visitors find 
you. They also give your community a way to contribute by editing the `tagWiki.yml` file that 
powers them.

## The First Step Is Edit 'tagWiki.yml' To Define Your Main tags

Don't do all of them, leave some for your users if you like. But you should define your main 
tags for your blog, release notes, or whatever else you have. In `tagWiki.yml`, you can just 
put a 1:1 mapping of tag name to the corresponding entry. 

For instance, ["announcements" on this site](/archive/announcements/):

```yml
announcements:
  summary: >
    The announcements tag is applied when there's a major announcement
    to make, such as a new release or other major news about the project.


    It's not used very often, so if you subscribe to a feed and see
    the tag, it's probably worth checking out.
  related_tags: ["updates"]
```

From this file, the theme knows what to print for the tag, and also 
that there's a relation to "updates", which it links as "Related"
in the sidebar.

BTW - you can use Markdown in the wiki summary.

## Tag-Specific RSS & JSON Feeds

To enable tag "feeds", that tag must have a wiki associated with it. Once
that happens, the feed and feed links will be auto-generated. The feeds
get generated the second the tag is created, but I don't advertise the 
feeds until I'm sure about the tag.

I designed it this way so that I'm not inadvertently offering ephemeral
feeds because I change my mind on a tag. If I make a tag, I might
decide I don't want it in a week, or change the name. But, if I make a tag 
and go through the chore of also creating the wiki, where I have to make 
myself write out how I'm going to use the tag, I'm way more inclined to keep 
it and not annoy people by deleting or re-naming their feeds.

This lets users create tag feeds for tags they care about, just by 
creating a wiki entry for it. You are, of course, free to change that in the 
template code if you wish. I develop features for the site while using it, 
so they tend to be centered around open-source use cases.
