# {title}

If you're familiar with Lume, you probably already know what's up; everything
below is just reference to you (I try to keep the examples up to date with 
what's live on this site).

For those that are new to Lume, _archetypes_ are scripts that Lume runs which can 
create base content for blog posts, content pages, photo galleries, or whatever other
content you have. 

In Cushy Text, this applies to three specific types of content that the theme knows
how to generate:

 - `blog` : A blog with a working tag system, feeds, tag wiki, tag feeds and 
    archives. Supports multiple instances with independent tags.

 - `docs` : Like a blog, but sidebar is auto generated, no archive pages, 
   tag pages, or author pages. Shows content rating form by default. Meant
   for technical articles.

 - `pages` : Full-page, sidebar-less MDX pages that aren't auto-linked, but
    can be tagged and are searchable. Meant for creating long-form content, 
    galleries, presentations, landing pages, company branding or whatever.
    Essentially the default when no archetype is specified in data.

A special file called `_data.yml`(these are important in Lume) in each directory 
controls default frontmatter settings for everything in that directory, and directories 
inside of it; this is a base feature of the generator.

Cushy Docs takes advantage of this by looking for special configuration directives 
that control how things get generated. Cushy Docs decides if the files in the current 
directory are a blog, a documentation collection, or a collection of content pages 
depending on settings contained in these files, and then generates things differently. 

To give you an idea of how this works, right now, you're actually in `/docs`,
which is a `docs` archetype (a documentation area, not robust like a blog). 
Let's take a look at the `_data.yml` file inside this directory, which affects
this directory, and all directories within it:

```yml
layout: layouts/docs.vto
waypoint: "%theme-docs%"
type: docs

docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  title: Cushy Theme Docs
  sidebar: auto
  guest:
    heading: "Latest Blog Post:"
    waypoint: "%blog%"
    posts: 1
```

This file instructs Lume "_for every file in this folder, apply these (...) settings_"
while the theme template picks up on the presence of `docs:` and adjusts accordingly
to switch layouts, generates the nav, etc. 

That special `waypoint` key is what I call a, well, _waypoint_. It lets me 
run multiple installations of `docs` while including content from each install
by a friendly name.

If I wanted to get _all content from all docs installs_, I would use an internal
search query of `type=docs`. However, if I want just results from _this_ documentation,
the theme docs in `/docs`, I would use `waypoint=%theme-docs%`. 

Now, let's take a look at the `blog` directory `_data.yml` file:

```yml
layout: layouts/post.vto
waypoint: "%blog%"
type: blog
tags: []

blog:
  basedir: /blog/
  title: Cushy Text Blog
  recent: 5
```

This works similarly to docs, but gives me a separate way to scope the 
content with behind the scenes: `%blog%`. It also makes sure `tags` is 
at least _set_, even if it's just an empty array, to avoid onerous 
checks in templates.

It's designed to allow running multiple blogs on the same site. For 
example: one for content, one just for release notes. Currently, only 
one centralized `/archive` for tags and authors is supported, but generators
along with templates they should use will be configurable per-blog in 
a near release.

## What About "pages"?

The `pages` archetype is under construction and will depend on finishing 
all of the components so that they can be made available as MDX elements.

Right now, there's plenty of utility stuff, but no real page-building 
stuff in the mix yet. That's coming up soon!

## Creation Scripts Included

You'll find `blog.ts`, `doc.ts` and `page.ts` included in `src/_archetypes`,
they're the bare minimum needed to qualify for having them. I plan to add
some additional arguments, or the ability to create by waypoint, but it's 
low on the priority list.
