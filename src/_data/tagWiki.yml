announcements:
  summary: >
    The announcements tag is applied when there's a major announcement
    to make, such as a new release or other major news about the project.


    It's not used very often, so if you subscribe to a feed and see
    the tag, it's probably worth checking out.

infima:
  summary: >
    Infima CSS is the base CSS framework for CushyText, written and maintained
    by Meta for Docusaurus 2. Cushy Text exists due to a desire to use Infima
    with Lume for highly-textual sites.

updates:
  summary: >
    The `updates` tag is similar to the `announcements` tag in that it
    is accompanied by news about Cushy Text, however it's used much more
    frequently than announcements.


    Part of the process of building Cushy Text has also been learning a
    lot about Lume, and I like to do my learning "out loud", so frequent
    updates are planned along with tutorials when I figure out things
    worth sharing.

hybrid-sites:
  summary: >
    Hybrid sites refers to a class of self-publishing software that uses
    a database-driven back-end CMS like WordPress or Notion for content
    creation and management, but exports the content to markdown with
    frontmatter that a static site generator like Lume can process
    into rendered HTML.


    Essentially, in a hybrid setup, the database server exists for local
    development, managing comments, managing drafts and media, and all of
    the other tasks commonly associated with it. What's different is that
    no queries are necessary to serve the generated pages.


    Because Lume 3 lends well to this with its Router middleware, Cushy Docs
    tries to lend well to being a theme for this sort of setup for technical
    authors and marketers.

wordpress:
  summary: >
    WordPress is the most-used content management system on the planet, and
    serves millions of websites every single second. Approximately 90% of
    those websites could very easily be powered by static site generators
    such as Lume, with significant carbon and energy savings as a result.


    A goal of this blog is to spread more information about Lume 3 in
    general in the form of tutorials and thought pieces, so naturally we
    want to cover the world's most popular CMS!

lume-3:
  summary: >
    Lume 3 is the core of this theme, is definitely the most flexible
    static site generator for Deno, and is arguably one of the most
    flexible available today. This theme takes advantage of several
    key new features in Lume 3 such as the router middleware, new
    component system, new and lightweight SSX MDX parser and more.


    We share Lume's perspective that most sites can easily be static
    sites, and part of what motivated Cushy Text was showing whats
    possible for technical content creators when a little interactivity
    becomes trivial to pursue.

opinion:

    A take on a matter considered to be at least somewhat subjective
    from the perspective of being a theme developer and major fan of
    static sites.

interactive-features:
  summary: >
    The interactive features tag covers the interactive features that
    ship with Cushy Text, as well as conversations in general about
    bringing interactive (dynamic) features to static sites, which
    are typically very feature-less.


    The Router middleware in Lume 3 re-starts conversations about
    expectations of static sites because it enables so many customary
    features that WordPress users enjoy, like being able to vote on
    and rate posts, leave and read comments, and other things.

static-sites:
  summary: >
    Static sites are websites deployed with every conceivable page
    pre-generated from a variety of data sources, including markdown
    text files or APIs designed to be fetched by content generators.


    Static sites are efficient and inexpensive to host on simple, often
    free platforms, and have a much lower environmental impact than
    sites that are generated dynamically on every request.


    The developer of this theme believes that most sites on the internet
    today can be at least partly static.

simple-seo:
