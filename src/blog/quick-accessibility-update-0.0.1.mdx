If you make web pages and haven't yet heard of [Sa11y](https://sa11y.netlify.app/), 
I strongly suggest checking it out at your earliest opportunity. Special thanks to 
Lume Community member [Pyrox](https://pyrox.dev/) for suggesting it. I had been 
bracing for a massive list of fixes that would be needed in order to call CushyText 
accessible, but quite amazingly, _we're already doing pretty well!_.

I'm definitely not calling the theme accessible in the first release (there's just not enough 
time for that at this point), I think it could be an accurate description by the second or third.

***Here's a run-down on how it went***, though you're welcome to try these yourself.

## Testing With Sa11y Was Way Easier Than I'd Anticipated

I put the following code in the header:

```js
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryersondmp/sa11y@latest/dist/css/sa11y.min.css"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/gh/ryersondmp/sa11y@latest/dist/js/lang/en.umd.js,gh/ryersondmp/sa11y@latest/dist/js/sa11y.umd.min.js"></script>
<script>
  Sa11y.Lang.addI18n(Sa11yLangEn.strings);
  const sa11y = new Sa11y.Sa11y({
    checkRoot: "body",
  });
</script>
```

And then I have flags on all of the elements that should interest me. I also have the
ability to test the site through different color filters to make sure the experience 
is still on-par. Check out [the site](https://sa11y.netlify.app/); it's a really useful tool!

But, I wanted multiple sources to help me understand the strengths of individual tools vs 
what they all tended to agree on, so I also checked things out with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
(web evaluation accessibility tool). 

Both tools flagged the same things in a similar way, and offered similar suggestions on how
to make changes, like offering alternate color codes, or instructions for better labeling.

[Here's a /dev route you can use to view individual components](/dev).

## So, What Did They Find? How Did It Go?

Well. I checked in some changes that fixed _a lot_ of instances where there's just not enough 
contrast with background and font color. All of the default Infima colors are just a _few shades_
too bright to be in the sweet spot where we can say we're sure all possible effort went into 
a great experience for everyone.

I've fixed the `--primary` side of things which corrected 95% of the detected problems, and made
more changes to things like badges, feed icons, tag wiki feeds and other parts. 

## 95% Of Issues Are Fixed. The Remaining Issues Will Take Longer.

What remains is:

 - `--info`, `--warning`, `--success` and `--danger` need to be re-styled to be a few shades darker, 
 along with whatever changes are needed for their respective hover / visited / etc states. 

 - Pagefind will (hopefully) soon add some missing elements to the form fields they place in the 
 document. 

None of the colors that could have contrast issues are in use in the default theme in a manner where
the contrast could be a problem, so these will be fixed over time, most likely as they get used by 
new theme components.

## This Will Likely Modify The Base Infima CSS. But, Not Fork.

Because of the hover and visited states, and some shared variables, it's going to be a really big 
problem to make all the color changes as overrides. It will be a lot of clutter. 

The theme already separates out variable definitions from the rest of the code, so all changes will
be confined to the variable definition files. This means they could conceivably be _applied_ as 
overrides if they had to be, like if you had to load the theme remotely from the Infima NPM package.

But, it will be completely accessible once done, at least as far as contrast goes. And if they ever 
push a major update (highly unlikely, but theoretically conceivable), it's still easy for me to apply. 

## Responsive &amp; Accessible: Here We Come!

It will likely take a few more versions (tab indexes need some attention too), but we're definitely 
way closer than I thought. 

And, well, it feels good to move farther away from the default Infima design without changing anything
fundamentally. We're doing our own thing over here, so a bit more individuality feels great!
