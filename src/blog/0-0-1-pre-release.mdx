Ã“scar Otero recently merged v3-dev into main which means while 
Lume 3 is still behind the `--dev` feature flag, it's all but 
a done deal. He expects to release Lume 3 sometime in May 2025.

Since it's basically feature complete, I've [tagged in](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext-theme/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
version `0.0.1` _mostly_ for the benefit of plugin testing and 
for early adopters who have existing infima content they're looking
to move over to Lume.

**[Here is a link to the new cushytext-theme repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext-theme);**
it will be turned into a proper template repository and listed in the Lume Theme registry
once Lume 3 has been out for at least a week. No one should still be pulling from this 
site's repo (cushytext.deno.dev) for the theme itself, use the cushytext-theme repo.

So, why would you want to check this out now, instead of just waiting for it to appear
in the Lume theme gallery?

Well, you might want to make use of the [SEO plugin](/docs/theme-plugins/#simple-seo), or 
perhaps you want to just poke around how things work. You're welcome to clone the theme,
run `deno task dev` and have at it. All of the documentation _ships with the theme_, so
as soon as you open your browser it's right there along with sparse demo content.

## But, Beware Bugs

Not only do you need to update lume nightly, you should also keep in mind that a few 
changes may be coming down the pike, so perhaps update via git only when new releases
are tagged in, while updating Lume daily for now.

## Use Case Feedback Is Helpful

Please spend some time reading the docs and short roadmap to spot things that I've already
identified as needing to happen soon. Let me know what you actually need out of a theme like
this and how it could be better for you, and I might be able to make it easier to accomplish.

I've tried to be "netural" to workflow style, but if something in the data layer or something
else is really getting in your way, please tell me as the iron is still very hot and easy to 
bend.
