There's a great Lume theme for pretty much every occasion now: building a wiki, starting 
a blog, promoting an event, publishing an ebook, sharing research - and  they're _all_ 
fantastic. I learned a lot about strategy when it comes to generating sites intelligently
by studying and using them.

There's always been something missing, though: a theme that lets me do _all_ of that in 
a cohesive way with unified search that doesn't feel all duct-taped together. I wanted
to be able to generate docs from many small collections of markdown files, run multiple
blog instances, build content and landing pages and have interactive features that take 
advantage of Deno, Deno Deploy & Lume 3's Router.

So, I created one! And, I named it Cushy Text!

## Multi-Instance / Multi-Archetype With Central Search

The goal is allowing multiple instances of blogs, docs and collections of pages on the same
site, under the same design, in a seamless experience for both creating and consuming. things
are separated by folder, and can even functionally have separate tags if you want. 

While posts and pages and docs are grouped together by _type_, they also each have a unique
identifier that I call a waypoint, which allows pulling content from one or several sources
easily. 

```yml
layout: layouts/post.vto
type: post
waypoint: "%blog%"
tags: []

blog:
  basedir: /blog/
  title: Cushy Text Blog
  recent: 5
```

This (among setting some base values) tells every page what layout to use, and 
to assign itself a key called a `waypoint` that is used behind the scenes to 
scope, include or exclude each blog or documentation instance from search,
navigation, feeds and more. 

An example use is how I pull titles from the blog over to the documentation 
sidebar:

```html
  <ul class="menu__list">
    {{ for entry of search.pages('waypoint=%blog% menu.visible=true', "date=desc", 1) }}
      <li class="menu__list--item">
        <a class="menu__link" href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {{ /for }}
  </ul>
```

If I had `%gaming-blog%` or `%recipes%` installed as blogs, I could easily pull
content from either or both, too. This is different than just having _types_, this
lets you scope specific _sources_.

`%` is used because it's easy to visually-distinguish waypoints from tags in back-end 
search queries; it can be changed if you want. It's the `blog:` key in `_data.yml` that 
turns on the archetype. The theme looks for `data.blog`, `data.docs` and `data.pages` 
while processing, so it knows how to treat each page.

## What About Feeds And Archives?

To control how feeds work, see `plugins.ts` (below is what's live on this site, notice
that documentation has its own independent feed):

```js
  .use(feed({ output: ["/feed.xml", "/feed.json"], query: "waypoint=%blog%" }))
  .use(feed({ output: ["/docs/feed.xml", "/docs/feed.json"], query: "waypoint=%docs%" }))
```

As long as each separate blog and documentation folder has a unique waypoint,
you can build navigation and search any way you like!

Hey, wait! _speaking of documentation .._

## A Mini-Docs & Wiki Engine Archetype Is Also Built-In!

You can [drop a bunch of markdown in a folder](/docs/), and add this `_data.yml` at the 
top level:

```yml
layout: layouts/docs.vto
type: docs
waypoint: "%theme-docs%"

docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  title: Cushy Theme Docs
  sidebar: auto
  guest:
    heading: "From Our Blog:"
    waypoint: "%blog%"
    posts: 1
```

Think of it like a very light version of a blog that generates its own sidebar based on 
the directory. It will soon support custom sidebars and more complex nesting. I really
like using one theme for everything, in a way that feels planned instead of bolted together.

Normally, docs installs won't have tag archives or author pages generated. They can _use_ 
tags to help aid search, but there's no display by default. Happy to add more use to tags
in docs if people have a stronger use case than my imagination.

## Interactive Features Included

Because Lume 3's router middleware makes form handling so convenient, and because DenoKV
is zero configuration on Deno Deploy and falls back to Sqlite3 locally, it's easy to ship
interactive features that "just work" without configuration.

You'll get a content rating system (_was this page helpful?_ kind of component) as well
as a contact form and submission handler.

More things may get added as a generally-available release nears.

It's time for static sites to liven things up a bit!

## Deno Deploy + Deno KV Ready! (And, Required)

Originally, I wanted to build an interactive theme that would conceivably work on any
host that offered Deno in some form (like Netlify), but two key things drove the decision
to just require Deno Deploy:

 - DenoKV solves all the dev / production issues surrounding interactive content, and, 
 - Lume 3 Middleware needs Deno to run _anyway_, so, 

I'm just going to focus development with the idea that we'll be running on Deploy. It would
not be hard to modify the default middleware that this theme comes with to use Postgres 
or even Redis, if you wanted to host on your own VPS or use Netlify edge functions.

## Component-Focused, But Not Strict 

Infima CSS has a lot of individual components that can easily be broken out into smaller
CSS files and small bits of helper Javascript so that they can be loaded only when needed. 
This aligns perfectly with Lume 3's re-designed components, and for brand new sites, you
get the satisfaction of knowing unused code never gets loaded.

If you use Infima and want to port existing markup over, that's fine too - you can use a 
version of the stylesheet that loads all of the component bits, so you can use the markup
anywhere. 

In all honesty it's splitting hairs, because it's only a few hundred lines of CSS and JS
combined, but _its the point, darn it!_

## Loaded Like A Baked Potato With Plugins

Apologies if you don't like potatoes. Cushy Text aims to ship with pre-configured plugins 
covering SEO, Content Optimization, Feeds, Engagement and More. The idea is to help you 
spend time writing and curating, not configuring plugins, unless you wanna.

I'm including my own SEO plugin that does static analysis checks of pages to make sure
things like lengths, common word densities, meta info and everything else is set as 
optimally as possible.

I mean really, [check out all these toppings](/features/#plugins)!

## Responsive And Accessible

Infima is notorious for being easy to build responsive sites with. But I also want to go 
the extra mile and make sure it's optimized for screen readers, offers font alternatives 
like "Open Dyslexic", obeys user preferences for theme and motion and is easy to translate.

All of that's baked into goals from the start, even if it takes a few versions of massive
DOM reorganizations before we can say it's living up to it.

## Ready To Ship March / April 2025

This theme depends on _a lot_ of new functionality in Lume 3, and will most likely ship 
two weeks after Lume 3 does. This repo is upgraded to `v3-dev` almost nightly and stays
in-sync with Lume development.

You're welcome to [grab the code](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext) and look around, 
but don't build anything serious with it until the actual release. I think most breaking 
changes are over, but you _never quite know_ ...
