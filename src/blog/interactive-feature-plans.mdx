I wanted to share more about ideas I had for additional islands of interactivity that
text-heavy sites could use, with some thoughts on which ones I'm planning to try to bring
to Cushy Text by default.

This isn't a final list, yet, but what I'm narrowing in on. If you have some ideas, let 
me know! I don't want to ship moving parts just for the sake of having more things to 
fidget with, so I'm really looking at ways to grab more signal from visitors.

For most of us, an understanding of our anonymous readers only comes from analytics data;
they're like cosmic objects that we can't directly observe, just infer with math. I'd like
to change that for static sites, at least a little!

## Document Rating System

Most document systems have a thumbs up / thumbs down sort of voting mechanism, along with a 
small form where additional free-form feedback can go. This is okay, but something I learned
about rating and reputation systems is _always give people a "meh" vote_. 

So, we'll make sure we don't force people into polar categories when we ask them for things. 

Additionally, _micro_ asks are helpful. Let's say you use a recipe site where you offer
ingredient volume conversions for different sized batches. You don't necessarily want people 
to fill out a book report on your recipe, _you just want to know if a specific conversion 
worked well_. That's something else I'm going to be tackling.

It will likely also have PostHog integration.

## Extensible Search

Using Pagefind under the hood, search queries will be submitted to router middleware on the
back-end and handled by code that interacts with the Pagefind API and can bring in results 
from other indexes (like if your company has a main site). It can also take advantage of the
tag isolation between each archetype in different folders, by including or excluding results
from them.

Because we're not using the Pagefind UI, search is easy to fully customize.

## Form Handlers & KV Operations

A handler to process and validate the included content page will also be included that inserts
the data into DenoKV. I'll include captcha and basic honeypot protection. You could easily change
it to go to email, or even to Discord - it's up to you.

How stored feedback is later displayed and eventually deleted is still up in the air, but I'm 
leaning toward hooks in Lume's CMS. 

## A Random Quote Server

Or something else that the site can load via `fetch()` that provides something 
to the visitor. Perhaps use it to load the last few Github commits, or even 
pull in some posts from Lume's blog. 

When it comes to "demo" things, I try to think of stuff that could easily be
modified to have some kind of lasting value.
