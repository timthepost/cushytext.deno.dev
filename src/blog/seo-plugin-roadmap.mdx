The [SEO plugin](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#just-using-the-simple-seo-plugin) 
did extremely well in the limited, but very thorough trials
with both English and non-english sites, and grew around ten
new configuration options in the process.

It's well-suited for light-to-medium production use. I want to 
talk about what it would need in order to run in reasonable time
with limited configuration if someone had tens of thousands of 
pages in multiple languages. Here's what I think the plugin needs
for the next major release:

<img

  alt="TODO: Description" 
  title="TODO: Title" />

{/* more */} 
  

  
## Object-Style Configuration

It has become clear that supporting words, characters, sentences, 
and the rest of the segmentation API is popular, but the exclusive
nature of one-for-all is frustrating. 

There's also the issue of n'th to the n'th options ending up in
this thing and I'm not really trying to emulate `wget` here.

So, we're going to move to a custom declarative syntax where we 
specify a number followed by the character 'c', 'w', 's' (character,
word, sentence, etc) for each option supported by the International
segmentation API. 

This would allow measuring titles in characters but overall content
length being measured in words, or even 'g' for grapheme.

## Hashing Of Content Document Object

Notice that, on every save, the plugin processes all of the targets 
again, even those that didn't change. If you have a blog with 50
posts that's not a big deal, but it could start to burn up your free
CI build minutes for something larger in several languages. 

A small but very pleasant change in Lume 3 is always being able to
count on the `document` object being available in the page object. 
It doesn't guarantee anything about what might be _in it_, but it 
does guarantee each page has one. We can use this to take a fast 
fingerprint to see if a page changed since last time, and possibly 
skip lots of segmentation at the cost of SHA1. That may or may 
not be an appealing proposition, depending on your circumstances. What 
matters is you have the option.

## Querying Of Index Status / Auto Update Crawlers

The plugin needs to be able to do these two things:

 1. Query Google Console API and retrieve the current 
    URL's status (indexed or not, why not, last visited, etc)

 2. Ping the Bing Webmaster Tools to notify crawlers 
    of content updates, so re-crawls can happen fluidly 
    and quickly.

This should not be hard to do once we have some method of 
caching / hashing.

That's more than enough to keep me busy for the next two or more 
releases, so we'll leave off here for now. Now you can better decide
if it's something you want to use at this stage or not. I hope this
roadmap was helpful in that decision!
