Have you ever had to explain to a customer that the way they were using 
something was what was causing their problem? It's usually awkward, and
really hard not to sound condescending or dismissive, but sometimes you 
just have to tell someone _hey, you're not going to get that thing to 
do what you're trying to get it to do_.

That's what it was like working in the hosting industry in the early 
2000s when people wondered why their WordPress site was suspended on a 
shared server for over-using resources. And that's when I hyper-fixated
on static sites as the only really naturally "scalable" solution.

**They still are.**

It wasn't that these blogs were being bombarded with traffic, its that
several of them getting crawled by Slurp on the same server would cause 
a cascading starvation of resources. When these sites were crawled
regularly and received substantial traffic, they quickly needed load 
balanced clusters. 

Unfortunately, you're just as, if not _more_ likely to become a victim of 
your own success if you _just_ use a database driven solution in 2025.


## To Begin, I Actually Like WordPress - A Lot!

WordPress might be the most successful fork in the history of free software.

That's not a trivial thing to say about _anything_. WordPress became what it 
is because someone saw something in it and knew that they had the unique vision
to make it a tool that people would love to use. And, for a very long time, if
you didn't want to hand-edit a whole lot of HTML, it was basically your only 
reliable option to launch a content site on a budget. 

But its design is fundamentally at odds with high-volume concurrent access,
has always been that way, and will always be that way. This goes for almost 
every site that unnecessarily puts a dozen database queries between every 
visitor and the page they want to see.

My early career in tech involved many sleepless nights because of PHP, MySQL, 
WordPress and Apache. They ruined relationships, caused pets to run away and 
my hair to fall out faster. But, I digress.

## WordPress Has Always Been Problematic To Host

Imagine that you have a fun evening with some friends planned. You're going
to meet your friends "Mork" and "Mindy" for appetizers at a new Italian place. 

You get showered, brush your teeth, style your hair, put on a nice outfit, 
some accessories and then you travel to the bistro and give your friend 
Mindy a great big hug. You see Mork over at the bar, so you go home, shower,
brush your teeth, put on a nice outfit and then travel back to the bistro 
and give Mork a great big hug. 

Wait, that's really wasteful, right? Why can't you just get ready once and 
meet more than one friend when prepared?

The same logic applies to database-driven sites that require a dozen queries for 
every connection that they serve, which is exactly the same for everyone else.

## The Best Cache Is Linux + A File System

If you want to see Linus get very animated and you're afraid to talk about
Rust in the kernel, just mention `O_DIRECT`. Go on, I dare you. Sneak up behind 
Linus and say ***BOO!*** `O_DIRECT` ***!!!*** Actually, don't do that; he knows 
martial arts and it's a bad idea to mess with people to prove silly points.

But back when all this insanity of using relational databases to store everything
in the world got started, he (like many) was flabbergasted by what the RDBMS 
enthusiasts wanted out of the kernel: a way to bypass all buffers and operate 
"on the metal" when they opened and wrote to the files that actually backed the 
data in their databases. 

The problem, as they saw it, was that I/O from buffers could not be guaranteed 
when systems were less than stable. And, they were right, but the elephant in
the room is that it was their database servers, and the way they were being 
leveraged so indiscriminately, that was causing all of the server instability 
to begin with.

Web hosts built offerings around how many databases you could have. Bad engineering
decisions is what drove growth back then, what can I say? But the fact that 
people are still starting out likely to topple over upon success is still 
extremely frustrating to me.

## "Caching" only goes so far.

Some might argue that WordPress and others do have caching plugins. They're 
correct, but PHP needs to be invoked in order to serve a static file. Sure,
caching helps, but if it's not just a plain text file that a lightweight web 
server can deliver, then it's overpowered.

Sure, some sites need to be connected straight to a database, like the sites
where we pay our bills, do our banking, check our order history, mindlessly 
scroll, etc. When each page varies greatly depending on who and where you
are, complexity makes sense.

To serve blog posts that seldom if ever change does not require complexity, 
it requires 12 lines of TS server code and a file system. Generating those
pages is a whole other matter, and where efficient tools like Lume come in.

I'm not saying get rid of WordPress. I'm saying _stop using it as a web
server_ and _stop continuously re-generating the same exact pages on 
every request_.

It really is as silly as showering and changing before greeting each 
friend in a line. 

## Efficient Servers Turn The Tables On Bad Actors

There are many _great_ hosts that are doing some really creative things 
with WordPress and many other open source content platforms, and giving
back not just money, but contributions in time and effort to improve 
the software. Those companies know who they are, and how much we love
them.

I'd like to talk about the other 97 percent, because a substantial amount 
of what's out there is [snake oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil).

There are a lot of not so great companies that prey on inexperienced site 
owners and the best way to fight them is to make people not need them in 
the first place. I think embracing the idea of the database being for 
creation and generation with comments and analytics on the side is sound, 
because so many pages out there don't need the overhead of being created
on every connection.

But that adds friction, and when you've taken money, your bottom line 
can't be very altruistic. So I see it as something that's important, 
but that the community needs to deliver.

Because continuing to watch new publishers become victims of their own 
success seems kinda dumb. Can't we come up with something easy for people
that also won't explode at the first sign of success?
