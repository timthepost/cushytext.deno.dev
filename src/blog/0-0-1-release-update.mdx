Want to know what's special about the OG image for this post? It was 
automatically created for the blog post by the 
[OG Image Generator](https://lume.land/plugins/og_images/) plugin. That
leads to my first update: [all of the planned pre-configured plugins](/features/#plugins) 
have been installed and configured to work correctly in conjunction with each
other.

That was originally going to be the main image for this post, but because Óscar is amazing 
and noticed the value in tag feeds, we now also now have proper tag wiki pages! Those 
get center stage:

<img
  class="blog_image"
  src="/uploads/blog/tag-wiki-screenshot.png" 
  alt="Screenshot Of The Tag Wiki System" 
  title="We have a tag wiki system, complete with tag feeds!" />

[Here's the generated OG Image, if you're curious](/blog/0-0-1-release-update/index.png).

There's more. A lot more. Once the theme is officially released, I'll have a proper
and frequently updated changelog so that users can decide when they want to cherry
pick something new or update. But for now, you'll just have to get by with me dumping 
it all in a blog post.

## Tag Wiki System, Complete With Individual Tag Feeds!

Lume 3 just added a new feature that allows you to pass a _function_ to the feed generator
so it can iterate over and render multiple feeds. This makes a _huge_ amount of sense for 
tags, and I'm really thankful that Óscar saw the value in it enough to implement it properly 
in the feeds plugin itself.

So, to generate RSS and Atom feeds for every tag on the site? Just a few lines of code in 
Lume `:)`:

```js
.use(feed(() => {
  const unknownTags = site.search.values("tags");
  const tags = unknownTags as string[];
  return tags.map((tag) => ({
    output: [`/feeds/tag/${tag}.xml`, `/feeds/tag/${tag}.json`],
    query: tag,
    info: {
      title: `Tag feed for ${tag}`
    }
  }));
}))
```

There's also a wiki feature that lets site admins or the community of people helping them add 
more information about tags. This helps to add more value for users, more SEO benefit to
pages that are ordinarily ignored for having no content, and provides a great place for tag 
feeds to be discovered. It also adds something easy for new contributors to maintain.

The tag info array along with manually-selected related tags is stored in `_data/tagWiki.yml`;
here's a trivial excerpt for `v0.0.1`:

```yml
v0.0.1:
  summary: >
    This is the very first release of Cushy Text, with the first release
    candidate planned for release the first week of April, 2025.
  related_tags: ["announcements", "updates"]
```

And that's how the related tags are managed. Simple is good.

Try it out on [the updates tag](/archive/updates/) _(which you should totally subscribe to;
go ahead, I'll wait ...)_

Thanks to Óscar for always being so gracious with his time for those who spend time with 
Lume! It's always more fun when the creator is super-involved and responsive.
  
## Search Is Pagefind (Only) For Now

It will continue to be Pagefind into the future, too. I mean it's 
_just_ Pagefind, which is in and of itself a great search engine.

I had planned to use Lume Middleware (Router) to augment search, 
by using the Pagefind API on the back-end and mixing it with
additional sources that can be `fetch()`ed, like a main product site
if Cushy Text is the user portal. 

That's still the plan, but it was too much to take on for the first 
release and still have it out reasonably soon after Lume 3 releases.

## Documentation Mini System Is Almost Feature Complete

You can have as many collections of documentation as you want, and 
they'll all get an auto-generated sidebar. You can set up
independent feeds for them as well. 

What it's not doing so well (yet) is handling nested directories.
All the files show up, but there's no inherited category definition,
so it's one long list of links. 

Docs will be made more robust in `0.0.2`. My goal for the first 
release was _"good enough to document itself"_, and we're way 
past that!

## Blog Is Almost Feature Complete

There's some pruning of markup and refactoring of a few things 
but the main functionality is all complete and stable. The blog
even has basic image auto-resizing if you follow the same path 
workflow as the sample post.

You can run several independent blogs, however they'll all share 
the same tag and author archive. Tag and Author archive locations
_might_ be configurable in `0.0.2`.

## Pages & Components Have Been Started

The quest to turn all of the various infima components into easy 
to use MDX elements goes slow, but it does progress. I hope to 
have completely pluggable (around 30 of them) Infima components
done by `0.0.3`, with a few trickling in each release.

## There Is Still Plenty To Do!

The interactive components, components in general, HTML markup cleanup
and accessibility audit, back-end code for managing feedback submissions,
theme artifacts for remote installs with sparse default content, and 
polish. 

But, the major lifting for the initial release is pretty much done. It's
exciting to be getting close!
