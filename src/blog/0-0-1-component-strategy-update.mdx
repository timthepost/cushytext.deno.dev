With waist-deep work on components underway, I'm starting to realize that 
the goals of separating out all of the CSS of all of the existing Infima 
components is just not practical. What it would likely do is just add an 
additional several dozen theme variables to make up for all of the places
where things like border colors, radius, and other extremely repetitive 
things are shared.

It **can** be done. As in, we could ship just the Infima design and spacing
elements and variables and dynamically load _all_ of the rest as it's used
but it's less than 100kb in total and it would require maintaining a separate
compatibility fork with everything loaded, or we break compatibility for 
those that have existing content.

  title="Let's call this one 'forced simplification'" />

There's _also_ the issue of, not every Infima component is most conveniently 
accessed _exclusively_ with a plugin: buttons, badges, even pills are mostly
stand-alone. And, importing markup from other Infima sites would be broken
unless you used the compatibility theme I'd need to maintain. Only alerts
and tabs _really_ lend to the model, as much as it seemed like the others did too.

So here's what I decided: We'll just load the Infima component CSS. We have 
plugins removing unused classes anyway. But, ***all the stuff built using 
those components will be Lume 3 components.*** Examples are the `comp.feedback()`
component I have brewing, plus Lume 2 style components that don't load css 
or scripts in `_components/`.

## You Can Still Component-ize The Infima Scripts

Look at `_components/alert.vto`.

If you wanted, you could easily turn that into
`_components/alert/comp.vto` and move the accompanying `_includes/js/infima/alert.js`
helper script that monitors for close events over to `_components/alert/script.js`. 

This will cause Lume to understand that script needs to be loaded when the component 
is invoked. You can do the same with some of the other scripts, but beware that they share
some functionality, and have subtle dependencies.

But if I did that _for everyone_, those who have existing Infima content would have 
trouble bringing it over unless they had a file that loaded every component. That's
silly, and not the good kind of silly.

## New Components Adding Styles Or Scripts ***Must*** Use The Lume 3 System

Let's say I'm writing a component that will return some styled block elements and 
has a script the client needs to run to pull in some data to show.

I would structure my component like this:

```bash
src/
    _components/
                widget/
                      comp.vto
                      style.CSS
                      script.js
```

What's going to happen here is when `{{ await comp.widget() }}` is invoked the first
time, Lume is going to put the contents of `widget/style.css` into `_site/style.css` 
and the contents of `script.js` into `_site/script.js` (if you use the defaults).

The template then loads those files, so it has any CSS and JS that was loaded along 
the way by components while generating.

However, ***if the component has no CSS or JS, just make it `_components/component.vto`
instead***. Don't add complexity just to make it a certain shape, if you don't need to 
load styles or scripts, just use the Vento template.

## This Change Only Affects The Existing Infima CSS Code

That's it. We're just loading all of the infima components as base CSS for our own components
to use. We're not further-componentizing Infima (unless, as noted above, you want to!)

It's your site, at the end of the day. Generate it the way you think it should be! I just
can't take patches that make componentization of the framework itself "hegemony".

Note that, it's not _usual_ to separate Infima components into individual files. It's just 
technically _possible_ with some lifting and compatibility layers in place. It's just not 
a good goal for this theme.

## This Change Removes Complexity & Maintainer Grief

People who have content with Infima markup and want to use Deno should always have an 
easy path to this theme and breaking that would make me very sad. But at the same time,
I don't want to maintain a "stripped down" version of the theme that gets further broken
down the way the existing one currently does - that's just way too much work for me.

So hopefully, you breathe a sigh of relief too, and look forward to making awesome 
components with the Infima building blocks (and whatever else you bring to them!)
