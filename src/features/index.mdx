# {title}

The developer of this theme worked in the technology industry, in a position
known as Developer Relations. In early-stage startup companies, the "DevRel" 
usually gets the honor of owning ***all*** of the documentation, and this 
theme was made out of the experiences of helping companies get set up.

This theme is designed for anyone who has to deal with a large amount of 
text content, who is comfortable working with Markdown, and is adventurous 
enough to try some components to ease the workload.

These are the _main_ features, though there are perks built into unexpected
places.

<h2 id="interactive">Static Doesn't Have To Mean Stagnate! Interactive Stuff Is Included!</h2>

The first two features to offer interactive engagement experiences will be a content rating
system that's currently visible on every page [in our docs site])(/docs/), with an accompanying 
admin plugin to view and delete feedback.

Things are working fine with DenoKV; we're also looking to implement a way to use Github Issues
as well as Discord to receive submissions.  

Check out the [blog update about additional features](/blog/interactive-feature-plans/) 
that are likely to also ship with the early release candidates!

<h2 id="blog">A Fully-Featured, Interactive & SEO Optimized Blog</h2>

The blog configuration brings a lot of robust features such as:

 - Tagging & Community Tag Wiki System
 - RSS/JSON Feeds for all posts, as well as individual, ***per-tag*** feeds.
 - Archive Pages For Posts, Authors & Tags  
 - Blog Homepage, which can become the site homepage if you want.
 - Automatic OG Image Generation. Built for writing tutorial-style content as well
   as essays. 
 - Code Syntax Highlighting with MDX lets you use a wide variety of components.
 - Auto Image Resizing: Upload blog images to `uploads` and _fahhhhhhh-get about it._
 - Interactive Content Rating System Powered by DenoKV, Discord, GH Issues or whatever
   you want to use to receive the feedback. Includes DenoKV and Discord by default.
 - Uses Lume's archetype scripts for new content creation.
 - Multi-instance capable: Uses "waypoints" to bucket content by blog installs for navigation
   and search discernment.
 - ***Is still in very active development; more features are coming.***

The blog is designed with a lone technical community manager or product marketing manager
in mind, and has everything they'd want to handle things from release notes all the way to 
tutorial and thought leadership content. 

Yes, documentation and landing pages are important parts of any kind of user or community
portal, which is the primary use-case for Cushy Text, but the blog is where many new groups
tend to spend the majority of their time in content development.

Speaking of new content development, do you want to write a new blog post? Just do this:

```bash
> lume new blog "new blog post title"
```

You'll have a draft in `blog/` with all frontmatter filled out with defaults, and a 
generated image based off of the title and description that will update as you edit
in serve mode. The creation experience is as important as the reading experience, from
the theme's perspective.

<h2 id="documentation">A Bare Bones But Effective Documentation System</h2>

Documentation is written like blog posts, with a few key differences:

 - You set your own H1 heading in the document (in blogs, this is automatic)
 - The sidebar is auto-generated based on file / title / menu order that 
   you control in frontmatter via `menu.order` and `menu.visible` for pages
   you want generated but not linked.
 - No archive pages are generated. While tags can be applied to documentation
   files, they aren't really used in the UI outside of search. You can of course
   change that.

But like Blogs, Documentation also has features that make your life as the 
site maintainer easier:

 - Multi-instance and independent with very minimal configuration (a few fields in `_data.yml`).
 - Waypoint-isolated so you can bring docs from specific sections of your site 
   into different feeds and navigation. Grab documentation from `%api-docs%` or 
   `%quickstart-tips%` or `%javascript-sdk%` easily.
 - Automatic search via Pagefind
 - Content rating system so users can give direct feedback
 - SEO Optimized 
 - MDX With whatever plugins you'd like to bring beyond the default that come with 
   Infima CSS.
 - Can also bring in content from other parts of the site  (e.g. release notes blog)

The bar for the Documentation feature to reach in order to be deemed worthy of inclusion
is its ability to document itself and the rest of the theme, which I think it managed to 
meet quite a few revisions and additional features ago.

It's still under active development, but I think the focus is more on perfecting the
features it has, not adding more. It's not supposed to outgrow something you can plop
in a directory and control with a _very minimal_ amount of YAML in whatever directories
you use it.

Like blogs, you'll be able to create a new documentation entry easily from templates 
that the theme provides, but some work will have to go into managing paths of installs
for those that have many and need to specify a destination. That's outside the scope
of the current `lume` CLI script.

<h2 id="simple-seo">A Comprehensive Static Analysis SEO Plugin</h2>
     
The theme handles setting up your content with all of the frontmatter present and
even pre-configured with default values where it makes sense. And, when you publish,
Lume makes sure that all of your content is presented _exactly_ as the theme designed
it, so it looks great on all screens.

But it's us pesky humans who write content, and forget or exceed certain things that 
make search robots not like our content very much, and all that planning gets wasted.

That's why the theme includes a plugin that runs a _lot_ of comprehensive checks on 
your content such as:

 - Meta information presence, length, percentage of common words
 - Content length checks (titles and content-body separately) as well as common 
   word density analysis in important fields like titles and descriptions
 - Checks on images and other HTML elements to be sure all properties are set correctly 
   (alt, title)
 - Checks to make sure the semantic document structure is correct (headings in order, 
   one main idea per page, etc)

It's not possible to produce a plugin that can forever guarantee amazing SEO results 
or make magic promises, and I'd caution anyone to treat anything that did with extreme
skepticism. Search engines are proprietary black boxes, so SEO is basically just religion 
you can grok through meaningful coincidences.

This plugin just helps make sure you're not getting in your own way with common mistakes,
so your content has a fair chance. 

<h2 id="responsive">Fully Responsive &amp; Working On Becoming Fully-Accessible</h2>

Infima makes creating 100% responsive themes easier than many frameworks, because it
mostly handles it behind the scenes for you. The theme includes Infima CSS plus a 
style sheet for overrides and some classes to make everything work. Content looks
great on screens of all sizes.

This theme also features light and dark themes with auto detection, the ability to 
toggle [Open Dyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org) for long blocks of content, which
you can apply by just adding a `font-selectable` class to the text container.

Now that _major_ development has slowed and the structure of the pages themselves
isn't changing drastically every day, the process of "finishing" the markup is 
under way, where special attention is also paid to labels that help guide readers 
as well as tab index settings that help keyboard navigation. Help in this area is 
greatly appreciated for anyone looking to work on something.

<h2 id="localization">Ready For Translation</h2>

No localization plugin has been installed _yet_, but all strings have been separated into 
two different locale files: `locale.yml` and `demo.yml`, located in the main `_data/`
directory. 

The `locale.yml` file contains strings that you're probably going to keep no matter how much
you customize the template. That's the file you should build on and take time to curate.

The other file `demo.yml` contains all the strings that make _this_ website's features work,
like the front page cards and such. Do whatever you want with those, they were kept out because
they would most likely be noise for translators.

<h2 id="components">Includes Lume 3 Components Built On Infima's Design System</h2>

Take a look at [the Infima documentation site](https://infima.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction) 
to see everything included with the framework. You have everything from a grid and 
markup-friendly spacing system to alerts and buttons, pills, tabs and many other
components that technical / text sites need.

Things that take advantage of these components are built as Lume 3 components, 
loading additional CSS and JS on top of the framework only when they're 
used. Alerts, Content Rating, and more coming like tabs, carousels and other
things content-heavy sites frequently need.

If you're curious and a little adventurous, you can have a look at [our component testing page](/dev/),
which also shows most of the Infima utility components and helpers.
